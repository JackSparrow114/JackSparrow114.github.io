            <p>In computing, React (sometimes React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library[2] for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations. React can be used in the development of single-page applications and mobile applications. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity, and scalability. As a user interface library, React is often used in conjunction with other libraries such as Redux.</p>
            <p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP.[6] It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012.[7] It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013. React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's React.js Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015. On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new core algorithm of React framework library for building user interfaces.[8] React Fiber will become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of the React framework.</p>
